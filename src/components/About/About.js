          I am a keen web enthusiast who loves to build complex systems and aspires to be a lead backend developer in the coming years. My journey started when I first wrote "Hello world" for the first time when I was 19 and from there I developed an interest in software development. Apart from that I occasionally learn investing which is my second hobby.
